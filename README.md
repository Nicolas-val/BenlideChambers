Benlide imaging chambers

Files and design instructions for 3D printed imaging chambers.

Work done by Ben Goodnow for EMBL Australia Node in Single Molecule Science at UNSW in conjunction with Rusty Nicovich and Kat Gaus.

PDF goes into more detail on comparison of these chambers to the commercially-available ones, as well as design rationale.  

Assembly instructions included in AssemblyNotes.txt.  For a single chamber, print off the base, main, and cover (optional) STL files.  Laser cut corresponding gasket. Then glue in magnets and you're ready to go!

Solidworks files available upon request (p.nicovich@unsw.edu.au).

End result - an imaging chamber that performs at least as well as a commercial one for standard-resolution microscopy for 1/50th the cost.
